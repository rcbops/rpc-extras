# Apt artifact repo configuration
# The rest of the apt artifact repo configuration is held in
# group_vars/all/apt.yml but due to the way that the rpc-maas
# implementation is done we cannot use group_vars to override
# the defaults, so we have to use extra-vars.
# TODO(odyssey4me):
# Refactor the rpc-maas implementation to make use of roles
# to implement the base repo/software so that these settings
# can be implemented in group_vars instead of extra-vars.

# MAAS
# The MAAS apt repo cannot be included in the integrated apt repository
# due to the fact that the same package name/version is used for multiple
# distributions, but the content and checksums are different.
