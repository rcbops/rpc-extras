# This file will contain any apt packages that the deployer would like to pin to a particular version.
# 
# This relies on the apt_package_pinning role from os-ansible-deployment.
#
# Pinning happens in the 'apt_pinned_packages' variable.
#
# apt_pinned_packages: 
#   - { package: "lxc", version: "1.0.7-0ubuntu0.1" }
#   - { package: "libvirt-bin", version: "1.2.2-0ubuntu13.1.9" }
