Extra
-----

Tags:
    If it's a bug that needs fixing in a branch in addition to Master, add a '\<release\>-backport-potential' tag (eg ``juno-backport-potential``).  There are predefined tags that will autocomplete.

Status:
    Please leave this alone, it should be New till someone triages the issue.

Importance:
    Should only be touched if it is a Blocker/Gating issue. If it is, please set to High, and only use Critical if you have found a bug that can take down whole infrastructures.


Style guide
-----------

When creating tasks and other roles for use in Ansible please create then using the YAML dictionary format.

Example YAML dictionary format:
    .. code-block:: yaml

        - name: The name of the tasks
          module_name:
            thing1: "some-stuff"
            thing2: "some-other-stuff"
          tags:
            - some-tag
            - some-other-tag


Example **NOT** in YAML dictionary format:
    .. code-block:: yaml

        - name: The name of the tasks
          module_name: thing1="some-stuff" thing2="some-other-stuff"
          tags:
            - some-tag
            - some-other-tag


Usage of the ">" and "|" operators should be limited to Ansible conditionals and command modules such as the ansible ``shell`` module.
