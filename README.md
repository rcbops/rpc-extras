Optional add-ons for Rackspace Private Cloud

# os-ansible-deploy integration

The rpc-extras repo includes add-ons for the Rackspace Private Cloud product
that integrate with the 
[os-ansible-deployment](https://github.com/stackforge/os-ansible-deployment)
set of Ansible playbooks and roles.
These add-ons extend the 'vanilla' OpenStack environment with value-added
features that Rackspace has found useful, but are not core to deploying an
OpenStack cloud.

# Ansible Playbooks

Plays:

* `elasticsearch.yml` - deploys an elasticsearch host
* `haproxy` - deploys haproxy configurations for elasticsearch and kibana
* `horizon_extensions.yml` - rebrands the horizon dashboard for Rackspace,
as well as adding a Rackspace tab and a Solutions tab, which provides
Heat templates for commonly deployed applications.
* `kibana.yml` - Setup Kibana on the Kibana hosts for the logging dashboard.
* `logstash.yml` - deploys a logstash host. If this play is used, be sure to 
uncomment the related block in user_extra_variables.yml before this play is 
run and then rerun the appropriate plays in os-ansible-deployment after this 
play to ensure that rsyslog ships logs to logstash. See steps 11 - 13 below 
for more.
* `rpc-support.yml` - provides holland backup service, support SSH key
distribution, custom security group rules, bashrc settings, and other
miscellaneous tasks helpful to support personnel.
* `setup-maas.yml` - deploys, sets up, and installs Rackspace
[MaaS](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/monitoring) checks
for Rackspace Private Clouds.
* `setup-logging.yml` - deploys and configures Logstash, Elasticsearch, and 
Kibana to tag, index, and expose aggregated logs from all hosts and containers
in the deployment using the related plays mentioned above. See steps 11 - 13 
below for more.
* `site.yml` - deploys all the above playbooks.

Basic Setup:

1. From ```/opt```, clone [rpc-extras](https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-extras)
with the ```--recursive``` option to get all the submodules.
2. Unless doing an AIO build, prepare the os-ansible-deployment configuration.
  1. copy everything from ```os-ansible-deployment/etc/openstack_deploy```
  into ```/etc/openstack_deploy```
  2. copy everything from ```rpcd/etc/openstack_deploy``` into
  ```/etc/openstack_deploy```
  3. Edit configurations in ```/etc/openstack_deploy``` for example:
    1. ```openstack_user_variables.yml.example``` and
    ```openstack_user_variables.yml.aio```
    2. There is a tool to generate the inventory for RAX datacenters, otherwise
    it will need to be coded by hand.
3. Run ```scripts/deploy.sh``` within ```/opt/rpc-extras```
  1. If building AIO, set ```RPCD_AIO=yes``` before running
  2. If building with Logstash, set ```RPCD_LOGSTASH=yes``` before running
