# Rackspace Private Cloud - OpenStack

The RPC-OpenStack repository contains additional scripts, variables, and
options for deploying an OpenStack cloud. It is a thin wrapper around the
[OpenStack-Ansible](https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible)
deployment framework that is part of the OpenStack namespace.

## Deployment options

There are two different types of RPC-OpenStack deployments available:

* **All-In-One (AIO) Deployment.** An AIO is a quick way to test a
  RPC-OpenStack deployment. All of the cloud's internal services are deployed
  on the same server, which could be a physical server or a virtual machine.

* **Production Deployment.** Production deployments should be done on more
  than one server with at least three nodes available to run the internal
  cloud services.

* **Upgrading the RPC-OpenStack Product.** Upgrading the RPC-OpenStack Product
  using intra-series releases.

### All-In-One (AIO) Deployment Quickstart

Clone the RPC-OpenStack repository:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack /opt/rpc-openstack
```

Start a screen or tmux session (to ensure that the deployment continues even
if the ssh connection is broken) and run `deploy.sh`:

Run the ``deploy.sh`` script within a tmux or screen session:

``` shell
tmux
cd /opt/rpc-openstack
export DEPLOY_AIO=true
export RPC_PRODUCT_RELEASE="pike"  # This is optional, if unset the current stable product will be used
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

The `deploy.sh` script will run all of the necessary playbooks to deploy an
AIO cloud and it normally completes in 90 to 120 minutes.

### Production Deployment Guide

Clone the RPC-OpenStack repository:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack /opt/rpc-openstack
```

#### Run the basic system installation

Start a screen or tmux session (to ensure that the deployment continues even
if the ssh connection is broken) and run `deploy.sh`:

Run the ``deploy.sh`` script within a tmux or screen session:

``` shell
cd /opt/rpc-openstack
export RPC_PRODUCT_RELEASE="pike"  # This is optional, if unset the current stable product will be used
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

#### Configure and deploy the cloud

To configure the installation please refer to the upstream OpenStack-Ansible
documentation regarding basic [system setup](https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/openstack-ansible/pike/configure.html).

Prior to running the OpenStack-Ansible playbooks ensure your system(s) are using
the latest artifacts. To ensure all hosts have the same artifacts run the
RPC-OpenStack playbook `site-artifacts.yml`.

``` shell
cd /opt/rpc-openstack
export RPC_PRODUCT_RELEASE="pike"  # This is optional, if unset the current stable product will be used
openstack-ansible site-artifacts.yml
```

Once the deploy configuration has been completed please refer to the
OpenStack-Ansible documentation regarding [running the playbooks](https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/openstack-ansible/pike/run-playbooks.html).

#### Optional | Disable Artifacts

It is possible to disable parts of the artifact deployment system RPC-OpenStack
provides. To disable the artifact components any of the following variables
can be set to **false** when running the `site-artifacts.yml` playbook.

* apt_artifact_enabled
* container_artifact_enabled
* py_artifact_enabled

If these variables are unset, they will automatically flip to **true** when the
respective artifacts are found. These settings are stored in the local fact file
`/etc/ansible/facts.d/rpc_openstack.fact`. If a deployer needs to completely
reset the state of artifacts, this file can be removed or modified as needed.

``` shell
openstack-ansible site-artifacts.yml -e 'apt_artifact_enabled=false' -e 'container_artifact_enabled=false' -e 'py_artifact_enabled=false'
```

These variables can be set on the CLI or within the `user_variables.yml` file.

When bootstrapping ansible using the `install.sh` script, if apt artifacts
are found to be available for the current release, the deployment host will
be configured to use them prior to executing the ansible bootstrap script.
This is to ensure that the only packages installed by that script are those
that from the apt artifact repository for the release. In order to disable
this functionality the bash environment variable `HOST_SOURCES_REWRITE` needs
to be set to anything other than `yes` before executing `install.sh`. Eg:

``` shell
export HOST_SOURCES_REWRITE="no"
./scripts/install.sh
```

#### Optional | Setting the OpenStack-Ansible release

It is possible to set the OSA release outside of the predefined "stable" release
curated by the RPC-OpenStack product. To set the release define the Ansible
variable `osa_release` to a SHA, Branch, or Tag and run the `site-release.yml`
playbook.

``` shell
openstack-ansible site-release.yml -e 'osa_release=master'
```

This option can be set on the CLI or within the `user_variables.yml` file.

#### Deploy the Rackspace Value Added Services

Upon completion of the deployment run `scripts/deploy-rpco.sh` script to
apply the RPC-OpenStack value added services; you may also run the playbooks
`site-logging.yml` to accomplish much of the same things.

``` shell
cd /opt/rpc-openstack
openstack-ansible site-logging.yml
```

Post deployment run the **optional** `site-openstack.yml` playbooks to setup
default flavors and images.

``` shell
cd /opt/rpc-openstack
openstack-ansible site-openstack.yml
```

### Perform an Intra-Series Product Upgrade

To run a basic system upgrade set the `${RPC_PRODUCT_RELEASE}` option, re-run
`deploy.sh`, and setup the artifact configuration for the deployment.

``` shell
tmux
cd /opt/rpc-openstack
export RPC_PRODUCT_RELEASE="pike"  # This is optional, if unset the current stable product will be used
./scripts/deploy.sh
openstack-ansible site-artifacts.yml
```

Once basic system configuration has completed, [run through the upgrade process](https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ansible/pike/user/minor-upgrade.html)
for the specified product release.  

### Perform a Major Product Upgrade (BETA)

To run a major upgrade set the `${RPC_PRODUCT_RELEASE}` option, re-run
`deploy.sh`, and setup the artifact configuration for the deployment.

``` shell
tmux
cd /opt/rpc-openstack
export RPC_PRODUCT_RELEASE="master"  # This needs to be set to the new product
./scripts/deploy.sh
openstack-ansible site-artifacts.yml
```

Once the deployment is ready either [run the major upgrade script](https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ansible/pike/user/script-upgrade.html)
or [run the manual upgrade](https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ansible/pike/user/manual-upgrade.html)
process.
