fixes:
  - This release fixes a race condition where the
    branding could be overriden depending on the playbook
    execution order. Deployers have to make sure the
    `horizon_custom_uploads` and the
    `rackspace_static_files_folder` from
    `rpcd/etc/user_variables.yml` are properly copied
    into `/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml`.
