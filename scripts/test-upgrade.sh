#       get dropped.

# TASK #6
# Bug:   https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/383
# Issue: The ceph-all.yml playbook will fail because of the hostname
#        changes introduced in Mitaka. This section recreates the mons
#        in a rolling fashion so quorum is maintained, and hostnames
#        are properly referenced in the ceph datasets(i.e monmap)
# NOTE:  Before running test-upgrade.sh on an AIO with ceph, variables
#        in the overrides file will need to be generated manually by
#        running migrate-yaml.py(similiar to TASK #0). The deployer
#        must ensure that osd_directory and raw_mutli_journal are not
#        both set to True in user_rpco_variables_overrides.yml. If this
#        isn't done, this TASK will fail.
#        In gating this is handled by gate-specific overrides set in
#        the jenkins-rpc repository.

# These are the instructions to give if there is a failure message on ceph-mon.yml
