To configure the installation please refer to the upstream OpenStack-Ansible
documentation regarding basic [system setup]

Prior to running the playbooks ensure your system(s) are using the latest
artifacts. To ensure all hosts have the same artifacts run the RPC-OpenStack
playbook \`site-artifacts.yml\`.

Once the deploy configuration has been completed please refer to the
OpenStack-Ansible documentation regarding [running the playbooks]
(https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/openstack-ansible/pike/run-playbooks.html).

Upon completion of the deployment run \`scripts/deploy-rpco.sh\` script to
apply the RPC-OpenStack value added services; you may also run the playbooks
\`playbooks/site-logging.yml\` to accomplish much of the same things.

  #                  a set of well known and understanable test scripts.
